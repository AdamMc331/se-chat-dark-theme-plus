// so I had to add 'watchers' so I could pick up the loading message being removed. 
// problems: I can't see the parent container, only the <i>loading...</i> node. 
// I also see this node 4 times :/ 
// solution was to look for the textContent and remove the watcher once it is hit
// watchers are confusing, I know. They are parsers but for removedNodes instead of addedNodes
// I should probably think of a new name for them. 
// Suggestions are welcome. 

const loadingDelay = node => {
	if( node.textContent === 'loadingâ€¦' ) {
		watcher.drain();
		watcher.removeWatcher(loadingDelay);
	}
}
let loaded = !document.querySelector('#loading');  // chat loads faster for some
if( !loaded ) {
	watcher.addWatcher(loadingDelay);
} else {
	watcher.drain();
}
