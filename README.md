# SE Chat Dark Theme Plus! 

This is the new home for rlemon's dark theme. 

Why the change? The re-write of this is more modular and I didn't feel like managing a new branch. 

### Usage 
The extension is not currently on the webstore so you'll have to install the development version found in /dist

Download the project (or just copy the contents out of /dist) 

Open `chrome://extensions` and click on the <kbd>Load unpacked extension...</kbd> button. 

Find the `dist` folder on your computer and load that. 

Please report any issues.
